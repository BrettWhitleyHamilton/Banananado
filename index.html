	<h3> About Me</h3>
	<p>Hi, I'm your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman.............I mean Hi, I'm Brett. I was a Honours BEng Computing student at Edinburgh Napier University.I graduated with a First class honours because I'm awesome. I live on the outskirts of Scotland's capital, Edinburgh. It's a beautiful city I would recommend going there one day. We have a castle on a rock, we have a dead volcano and a deserted underground city.

I enjoy building stuff ever since I was kid playing with Lego thats why I enjoy coding and creating graphics. Coding is essentially an adult mans's Lego........or womans. Drawing was also a passion of mine from a very early age. It is so satisfying when people enjoy your work. Once I discovered Photoshop, I was building art using different techniques, filters and brushes. Some of my designs that I'm very happy with get put onto my Redbubble account where I can earn a small profit from.

Movies are one of my favourite things,not because they give me enjoyment from watching action or comedy. No its because I'm fascinated with how movies are made. I will watch the behind-the-scenes features just to see how they did the effects.My favourite movie ever is Jurassic Park not because its a fantastic movie but because of the dinosaurs. THe dinosaurs are what brought the film to life. The use of animatronics and CGI is what makes me love this movie so much. These effects are better than half visual effect that are used in movies today.

From university I have gained many languages,skills and techniques.Here is a list of some of the languages:
SQL
PHP
JAVA
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
C#
Pascal
Android

I am hoping to add more to this list and improve my coding knowledge.
